![image](https://github.com/luiscoco/Azure_Services_review/assets/32194879/ed0d0a1e-f4f9-4079-b430-20bf9ae5a124)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/data-integration-azure-data-factory/?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/

In the world of big data, raw, unorganized data is often stored in relational, non-relational, and other storage systems

However, on its own, raw data doesn't have the proper context or meaning to provide meaningful insights to analysts, data scientists, or business decision makers

Big data requires a service that can orchestrate and operationalize processes to refine these enormous stores of raw data into actionable business insights

Azure Data Factory is a managed cloud service that's built for these complex hybrid **extract-transform-load** (**ETL**), **extract-load-transform** (**ELT**), and data integration projects

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a set of capabilities dedicated to **big data analytics**, built on Azure Blob Storage

A **data lake** is a single, centralized repository where you can store all your data, both structured and unstructured

A data lake enables your organization to quickly and more easily store, access, and analyze a wide **variety of data** in a single location

With a data lake, you don't need to conform your data to fit an existing structure

Instead, you can store your data in its raw or native format, usually as files or as binary large objects (blobs)

**Azure Data Lake Storage** is a cloud-based, enterprise data lake solution

You use it to capture data of any type and ingestion speed in a single location for easy access and analysis using various frameworks

Data Lake Storage Gen2 includes the following capabilities.

Hadoop-compatible access

Hierarchical directory structure

Optimized cost and performance

Finer grain security model

Massive scalability

For creating a **new Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** we have to create a new Azure Storage Account and select the following option

If you would like to **upgrade an existing Azure Storage Account** to become Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 select the following option

Previously you should unselect the options soft delete blobs and containers
